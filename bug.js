In Next.js, a subtle issue can occur when using dynamic `import()` within a component's `useEffect` hook, especially when that component is on a route with dynamic segments.  If the import path is incorrectly constructed using values from the `router` object without proper handling of edge cases or potential race conditions, it can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, attempting to import a module based on a route parameter that hasn't yet resolved will fail.
