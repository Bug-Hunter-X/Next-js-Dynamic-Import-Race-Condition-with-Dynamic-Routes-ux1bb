# Next.js Dynamic Import Race Condition with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using dynamic `import()` statements within `useEffect` hooks in Next.js components that utilize dynamic route segments.  The problem arises from potential race conditions where the route parameters might not be fully resolved when the `import()` statement executes, leading to failed imports or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file illustrates the problematic code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the race condition.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Navigate to the repository directory:
   `cd [repository_name]`
3. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
4. Run the development server:
   `npm run dev`

## Problem Description

The bug stems from attempting to import modules asynchronously based on dynamic route parameters within the `useEffect` hook before the parameters are fully loaded.  This can lead to errors, incorrect module loading, or unexpected runtime behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the route parameters are reliably available before attempting the dynamic import.  This is accomplished by using the router's `isReady` property or a similar mechanism to avoid potential race conditions.
